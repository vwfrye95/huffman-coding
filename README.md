This is a compression/decompression program first developed in my data structures class.  I am re-creating this program here in Java instead of C# and expanding on it in order to improve my java knowledge.

When I first created this program, I was provided a basic guideline of Huffman coding process.  The development of the program itself, documentation of the requirements and usage of the program, and a testing plan were all parts of the class final project.  The specifics (language, testing, etc.) were completely up to student discretion.
